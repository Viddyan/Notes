### Bitwise Operators:

#### 1. **Introduction (What, Why, How)**

- **What**:  
  Bitwise operators perform operations directly on binary representations of integers. Instead of manipulating the entire number as a whole, bitwise operators manipulate individual bits (0s and 1s) of an integer.

- **Why**:  
  Bitwise operators are important in low-level programming, optimizing performance, and working with hardware-level operations. They allow efficient operations, particularly when working with flags, permissions, encryption, data compression, and bit manipulation.

- **How**:  
  These operators work by applying binary operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, etc.) on corresponding bits of two numbers, or by shifting bits left or right. Common bitwise operators include AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), left shift (`<<`), and right shift (`>>`).

#### 2. **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:
- Understand what bitwise operators are and their role in programming.
- Perform bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.
- Use bit shifting to manipulate binary data.
- Apply bitwise operators to solve real-world problems like setting flags or toggling bits.

#### 3. **Essential Concepts (Building Blocks)**

1. **Binary Representation**
   - Computers store data in binary (base 2) format, using 0s and 1s to represent numbers.
   - For example, the number `5` in binary is represented as `0101`.

2. **Common Bitwise Operators**

   | Operator | Symbol | Description                                                 | Example                          |
   |----------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | AND      | `&`    | Performs a bitwise AND operation. Only sets a bit to `1` if both corresponding bits are `1`. | `0101 & 0011 = 0001`             |
   | OR       | `|`    | Performs a bitwise OR operation. Sets a bit to `1` if either corresponding bit is `1`. | `0101 | 0011 = 0111`             |
   | XOR      | `^`    | Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR). Sets a bit to `1` if exactly one corresponding bit is `1`. | `0101 ^ 0011 = 0110`             |
   | NOT      | `~`    | Inverts all the bits (1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1).            | `~0101 = 1010` (for 4-bit value) |
   | Left Shift | `<<` | Shifts all bits to the left by a specified number of positions. | `0101 << 1 = 1010`               |
   | Right Shift | `>>` | Shifts all bits to the right by a specified number of positions. | `0101 >> 1 = 0010`               |

3. **AND (`&`) Operation**
   - The AND operator compares each bit of two numbers and sets the result bit to `1` only if both bits are `1`. Otherwise, it sets the result bit to `0`.

   **Example**:  
   ```pseudocode
   5 & 3:
   5 -> 0101
   3 -> 0011
   -----------
   Result -> 0001 (which is 1 in decimal)
   ```

4. **OR (`|`) Operation**
   - The OR operator compares each bit of two numbers and sets the result bit to `1` if at least one of the bits is `1`.

   **Example**:  
   ```pseudocode
   5 | 3:
   5 -> 0101
   3 -> 0011
   -----------
   Result -> 0111 (which is 7 in decimal)
   ```

5. **XOR (`^`) Operation**
   - The XOR operator compares each bit of two numbers and sets the result bit to `1` only if the corresponding bits are different.

   **Example**:  
   ```pseudocode
   5 ^ 3:
   5 -> 0101
   3 -> 0011
   -----------
   Result -> 0110 (which is 6 in decimal)
   ```

6. **NOT (`~`) Operation**
   - The NOT operator inverts all the bits of the number (1 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 1). However, it's important to note that NOT operation on signed integers will invert not only the bits but also affect the sign bit.

   **Example**:  
   ```pseudocode
   ~5:
   5 -> 0101 (for a 4-bit number)
   -----------
   Result -> 1010 (which is -6 in two's complement representation)
   ```

7. **Left Shift (`<<`)**
   - The left shift operator shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, effectively multiplying the number by `2` for each shift.

   **Example**:  
   ```pseudocode
   5 << 1:
   5 -> 0101
   -----------
   Result -> 1010 (which is 10 in decimal)
   ```

8. **Right Shift (`>>`)**
   - The right shift operator shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions, effectively dividing the number by `2` for each shift.

   **Example**:  
   ```pseudocode
   5 >> 1:
   5 -> 0101
   -----------
   Result -> 0010 (which is 2 in decimal)
   ```

#### 4. **Hands-On Coding (Real-World Implementations)**

2. **Bitwise OR Example**  
   Setting a particular bit in a number.
   ```pseudocode
   function setBit(num, position):
       return num | (1 << position)
   ```

3. **Bitwise XOR Example**  
   Swap two numbers using XOR without a temporary variable.
   ```pseudocode
   function swap(a, b):
       a = a ^ b
       b = a ^ b
       a = a ^ b
   ```

4. **Left Shift Example**  
   Multiply a number by `2` using the left shift operator.
   ```pseudocode
   function multiplyByTwo(n):
       return n << 1
   ```

5. **Right Shift Example**  
   Divide a number by `2` using the right shift operator.
   ```pseudocode
   function divideByTwo(n):
       return n >> 1
   ```

           count = count + (num & 1)
           num = num >> 1
       return count
   ```
