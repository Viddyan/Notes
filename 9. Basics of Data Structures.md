### Basics of Data Structures:

#### 1. **Introduction (What, Why, How)**

- **What**:  
  Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. They allow us to store data in a structured manner and perform various operations such as retrieval, insertion, deletion, and searching.

- **Why**:  
  Understanding data structures is crucial for building efficient software. They help in managing and organizing data, which in turn improves the performance of algorithms. Proper use of data structures allows developers to handle large datasets, minimize memory usage, and optimize processing time.

- **How**:  
  Data structures are categorized into two main types: primitive (e.g., integers, characters) and non-primitive (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees). Each data structure has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of a data structure depends on the type of operations you need to perform and the nature of the data.

#### 2. **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:
- Understand the basic concepts of data structures.
- Know the different types of data structures and when to use them.
- Implement common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- Understand how to measure the efficiency of data structures using time and space complexity.

#### 3. **Essential Concepts (Building Blocks)**

1. **Data Structure Types**

   - **Linear Data Structures**:  
     Elements are arranged in a sequential order. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
   
   - **Non-Linear Data Structures**:  
     Elements are arranged hierarchically or in an unordered manner. Examples include trees and graphs.

2. **Array**

   - **What**:  
     An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or key. It is a fixed-size, homogeneous data structure, meaning it can only store elements of the same data type.
   
   - **Why**:  
     Arrays allow direct access to elements via their indices, making them efficient for read operations.
   
   - **How**:  
     In an array, elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, and the index starts from 0.
   
   **Example (pseudocode)**:
   ```pseudocode
   array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   element = array[2]  // Accesses the 3rd element, which is 3
   ```

3. **Linked List**

   - **What**:  
     A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node using a pointer/reference.
   
   - **Why**:  
     Linked lists are dynamic and can grow or shrink in size. They allow efficient insertion and deletion at any position.
   
   - **How**:  
     A linked list consists of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
   
   **Example (pseudocode)**:
   ```pseudocode
   Node {
       data
       next  // Pointer to the next node
   }
   head -> Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> NULL
   ```

4. **Stack**

   - **What**:  
     A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. Elements are added to and removed from the top of the stack.
   
   - **Why**:  
     Stacks are useful in scenarios where the most recent element added needs to be processed first, such as undo operations, recursive function calls, and parsing expressions.
   
   - **How**:  
     Operations in a stack include `push` (to add an element), `pop` (to remove an element), and `peek` (to view the top element).
   
   **Example (pseudocode)**:
   ```pseudocode
   stack = []
   stack.push(1)  // Stack: [1]
   stack.push(2)  // Stack: [1, 2]
   stack.pop()    // Stack: [1]
   ```

5. **Queue**

   - **What**:  
     A queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
   
   - **Why**:  
     Queues are useful in scenarios where elements need to be processed in the order they were added, such as scheduling tasks, handling requests in web servers, and breadth-first search in graphs.
   
   - **How**:  
     Operations in a queue include `enqueue` (to add an element) and `dequeue` (to remove an element).
   
   **Example (pseudocode)**:
   ```pseudocode
   queue = []
   queue.enqueue(1)  // Queue: [1]
   queue.enqueue(2)  // Queue: [1, 2]
   queue.dequeue()   // Queue: [2]
   ```

6. **Tree**

   - **What**:  
     A tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes. Each node contains data, and the nodes are connected via edges.
   
   - **Why**:  
     Trees are used in scenarios where data is hierarchical, such as file systems, organization charts, and decision trees.
   
   - **How**:  
     The most common type of tree is a binary tree, where each node has at most two children (left and right). The root node is the topmost node in a tree.
   
   **Example (Binary Tree pseudocode)**:
   ```pseudocode
   Node {
       data
       left  // Pointer to the left child
       right  // Pointer to the right child
   }
   ```

7. **Graph**

   - **What**:  
     A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between nodes). Graphs can be directed or undirected.
   
   - **Why**:  
     Graphs are used to model relationships between data points. They are used in social networks, road networks, and recommendation systems.
   
   - **How**:  
     A graph can be represented using an adjacency list or adjacency matrix.
   
   **Example (Adjacency List pseudocode)**:
   ```pseudocode
   Graph {
       vertices
       edges  // List of edges connecting the vertices
   }
   ```

#### 4. **Hands-On Coding (Real-World Implementations)**

1. **Array Implementation (Insertion, Deletion)**  
   ```pseudocode
   array = [10, 20, 30, 40]
   // Insert element at index 2
   insert(array, index, value) {
       shift elements to the right from index
       array[index] = value
   }
   ```

2. **Linked List Implementation (Insertion, Traversal)**  
   ```pseudocode
   Node {
       data
       next
   }
   insert(head, value) {
       newNode = Node(value)
       newNode.next = head
       head = newNode
   }
   traverse(head) {
       current = head
       while current != NULL:
           print(current.data)
           current = current.next
   }
   ```

3. **Stack Implementation (Push, Pop)**  
   ```pseudocode
   stack = []
   push(stack, value) {
       stack.append(value)
   }
   pop(stack) {
       return stack.pop()
   }
   ```

4. **Queue Implementation (Enqueue, Dequeue)**  
   ```pseudocode
   queue = []
   enqueue(queue, value) {
       queue.append(value)
   }
   dequeue(queue) {
       return queue.pop(0)
   }
   ```

#### 5. **Guided Exercises (Practice Tasks)**

1. **Write a function to reverse an array using a loop.**
   ```pseudocode

       end = length(arr) - 1
       while start < end:
           swap(arr[start], arr[end])
           start++
           end--
   ```

2. **Implement a function to insert a node at the end of a linked list.**
   ```pseudocode
   function insertAtEnd(head, value):
       newNode = Node(value)
       if head == NULL:
           head = newNode
       else:
           current = head
           while current.next != NULL:
               current = current.next
           current.next = newNode
   ```

3. **Write a function to implement a stack using an array.**
   ```pseudocode
   stack = []
   function push(value):
       stack.append(value)

   function pop():
       if not empty(stack):
           return stack.pop()
   ```

#### 6. **Interview Preparation**

#### 7. **Wrap-Up**

Data structures are the foundation of efficient algorithms and software development. Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs all serve different purposes in solving various problems. Choosing the right data structure depends on the type of operations you need and the complexity of those operations.
