### Encryption Standards & Algorithms:

#### 1. **Introduction (What, Why, How)**

- **What**:  
  Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (encoded data) using algorithms and keys, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the original information. Encryption standards refer to established specifications for encryption methods that ensure the secure and reliable protection of data.

- **Why**:  
  Encryption is crucial for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining confidentiality. It is widely used in secure communications, online transactions, and data storage.

- **How**:  
  Encryption is achieved through algorithms that utilize keys to perform transformations on the data. The choice of encryption standard and algorithm depends on the specific use case, desired security level, and performance requirements.

#### 2. **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of encryption and its importance.
- Identify common encryption standards and algorithms.
- Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
- Recognize the use cases for various encryption algorithms.
- Implement basic encryption techniques using popular libraries.

#### 3. **Essential Concepts (Building Blocks)**

1. **Encryption Fundamentals**
   - **Plaintext**: The original, readable data that needs protection.
   - **Ciphertext**: The encrypted data that is unreadable without decryption.
   - **Key**: A string of bits used by an encryption algorithm to transform plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.

2. **Types of Encryption**
   - **Symmetric Encryption**:  
     Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It is faster and suitable for encrypting large amounts of data but requires secure key distribution.
     - **Examples**: AES, DES, Blowfish.

   - **Asymmetric Encryption**:  
     Uses a pair of keys (public key for encryption and private key for decryption). It is more secure for key exchange but slower than symmetric encryption.
     - **Examples**: RSA, DSA, ECC.

3. **Common Encryption Standards**
   - **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**:  
     An older symmetric encryption standard that uses a 56-bit key. Considered insecure for many applications today due to its short key length.

   - **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**:  
     A widely used symmetric encryption standard that supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. It is efficient and secure, making it suitable for a variety of applications.

   - **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**:  
     A widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers. Commonly used for secure data transmission.

   - **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**:  
     An asymmetric encryption method that offers similar security to RSA with much smaller key sizes, making it more efficient.

4. **Hash Functions**
   - **Definition**: Hash functions take an input and produce a fixed-size string of bytes (the hash) that is unique to each unique input. They are commonly used to ensure data integrity.
   - **Examples**: SHA-256, SHA-3, MD5 (not recommended for secure applications due to vulnerabilities).

5. **Digital Signatures**
   - **Definition**: Digital signatures use asymmetric encryption to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message. The sender signs the message with their private key, and the recipient can verify it using the sender's public key.

#### 4. **Hands-On Coding (Real-World Implementations)**

1. **Symmetric Encryption with AES in Python**:
   ```python
   from Crypto.Cipher import AES
   from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad
   import os

   # Key and data
   key = os.urandom(16)  # AES key (128 bits)
   data = b'Secure this message'

   # Encrypt
   cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
   ct_bytes = cipher.encrypt(pad(data, AES.block_size))
   print(f'Ciphertext: {ct_bytes.hex()}')

   # Decrypt
   cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, cipher.iv)
   pt = unpad(cipher.decrypt(ct_bytes), AES.block_size)
   print(f'Decrypted: {pt.decode()}')
   ```

2. **Asymmetric Encryption with RSA in Python**:
   ```python
   from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
   from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP

   # Generate RSA keys
   key = RSA.generate(2048)
   private_key = key.export_key()
   public_key = key.publickey().export_key()

   # Encrypt message
   cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(RSA.import_key(public_key))
   message = b'Secure this message'
   ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(message)
   print(f'Ciphertext: {ciphertext.hex()}')

   # Decrypt message
   cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(RSA.import_key(private_key))
   decrypted_message = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
   print(f'Decrypted: {decrypted_message.decode()}')
   ```

3. **Hashing with SHA-256 in Python**:
   ```python
   import hashlib

   # Hash a message
   message = b'Secure this message'
   hash_object = hashlib.sha256(message)
   hex_dig = hash_object.hexdigest()
   print(f'SHA-256 Hash: {hex_dig}')
   ```
